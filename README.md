# Interfacing-LM35-Temperature-sensor-with-Arduino-
This Project is about reading the temperature using LM35 temperature sensor and Blinking Led by comparing with temperature Values.
Conditions for Blinking LED : 
                        1) Blinking with delay of 250ms, if temperature is less than 30°C.
                        2) Blinking with delay of 500ms, if temperature is greater than 30°C
# Hardware Required:
                    Arduino Uno Board, LM35, Led.
# Software Required:
                    Arduino IDE.
